# 🏥 Emergency Medical Fund Smart Contract

## 📌 What is it?

The **Emergency Medical Fund** is a decentralized smart contract where **family, friends, or community members can pool funds together** to support a patient during medical emergencies.
 
Unlike traditional fundraising platforms where funds can be delayed or misused, this contract ensures that **contributed money is only released directly to verified hospitals** once an emergency is confirmed by a trusted oracle.

If no emergency occurs within a defined period, contributors can **withdraw their funds back proportionally**, ensuring transparency and fairness.
